### What does this script do and desn't do
- I didn't hanndle to do everything asked in the assigment and my programming skills are also poor, but at least I tried it ...
- I didn't understand the system of measurments of particular subjects
- The script does not compute the mean and standard deviation for each individual subject
- It only merges "train" and "test" datasets and computes means and standard deviations for each activity, but it cumutes values from all subjects, not subject by subject
- It creates the matrix with activity names and values of means and standard deviations and this is saved into a txt. file

### Running the script

- Download this script
- Download the [data] (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)
- Extract files from archive
- Modify the path variable in the script so that your current directory will be "UCI HAR Dataset", containing all the data needed for the analysis
- Run the script in R
- If everything goes well, the tidy dataset will be created in the current directory as "tidy-dataset.txt"
